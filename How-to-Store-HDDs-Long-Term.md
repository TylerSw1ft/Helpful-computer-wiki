Things you need to protect the drive against:

1. Excessive temperature (hot or cold, check the spec sheet) - Store it in a room temperature location away from sunlight
2. Moisture - The storage room/area should either be dehumidified or you should blow air across the HDD using a fan
3. Shock - Store it where it won't be dropped, in a [protective sleeve](https://www.startech.com/HDD/Brackets/35in-Silicone-Laptop-Hard-Drive-Protector-Sleeve-with-Connector-Cap~HDDSLEV35)
4. Dust (low risk unless you never vacuum or change your HVAC filters) - Put it in a zip-lock bag
5. You forgetting where it is (your biggest risk) - Make a note somewhere. Out of sight devices tend to be out of mind and wind up being dropped, crushed by items set on top of them, flooded by spills, or just straight up lost

BTW, you can take care of all the above by just leaving it running (while minimizing power cycling and not spinning down) in an enclosure or (safely located) dock. All my HDDs are always running for this reason.

Either of the above options should give your HDD effectively infinite life.
