NAS HDDs are basically Datacenter Lite HDDs with actually Datacenter HDD pricing (seriously, look up the price comparisons.) If you put their normalized specs into Excel NAS drives are actually a worse value for money.

Here's an example (as of 2019-07-12):

The following are the lowest prices - including lowest cost shipping to the continental US - for 12 TB Seagate HDDs from a reputable (4+ stars) retailer on Google Shopping:

* Seagate Exos X12 12 TB (the highest spec 12 TB drive Seagate makes): [$322.44](https://www.provantage.com/seagate-st12000nm0007sp~7SEG914W.htm)
* Seagate IronWolf Pro 12TB: [$401](https://www.discountbandit.com/seagate-ironwolf-pro-12tb-3-5-internal-desktop-hard-drive-sata-6gb-s-7200rp.html)
* Seagate IronWolf 12TB: [$356.93](https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16822172025?item=N82E16822172025)

**The Exos X12 has the highest specs of all 3 drives, but the lowest price**
