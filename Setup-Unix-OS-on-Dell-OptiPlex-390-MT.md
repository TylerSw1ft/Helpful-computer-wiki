# Status

Archived due to lack of Resilio Sync support, which would make my workflow difficult to impossible. 

# OS Choice

[OpenIndiana](https://www.openindiana.org/)

# Rationale

* I want to run all major OS families
* I still need a UNIX OS to fulfill the above
* MacOS isn't affordable
* None of the other certified and licensed UNIX solutions are easily available or actively supported
