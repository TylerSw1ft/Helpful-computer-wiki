# What I'm gonna do for:

## RAM

Upgrade to 16 GB

## Storage

### ZFS

[Unused HDDs](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/blob/master/Unused.md#35-in) in RAIDZ1

### Backup

Time Slider to ZFS pool

# Synced Folder Access

OpenIndiana does not have a Resilio Sync build, therefore might have to mount shared NFS folders from [Debian 10 machine](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/blob/master/Dell%20OptiPlex%20390-1%20SFF.md)
