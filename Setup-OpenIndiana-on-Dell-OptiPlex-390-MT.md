# What I'm gonna do for:

## Storage

### Boot/OS & `/home`

~~Crucial MX500 [1 TB](https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/ct1000mx500ssd1) or [2 TB](https://www.crucial.com/usa/en/ct2000mx500ssd1) SATA 2.5" 7mm Internal SSD~~ Going to use retired 32 GB Samsung mSATA SSD installed in StarTech.com mSATA to 2.5 in SATA adapter, installed in Icy Dock 2.5 in to 3.5 in adapter, instead

### ZFS

[Unused HDDs](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/blob/master/Unused.md#35-in) in RAIDZ1

### Backup

Time Slider to ZFS pool

# Synced Folder Access

OpenIndiana does not have a Resilio Sync build, therefore might have to mount shared NFS folders from [Debian 10 machine](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/blob/master/Dell%20OptiPlex%20390-1%20SFF.md)
