You'll need >2X your usable storage:

* 1X for primary storage
* 1X for backups
* ≥1X for *any* data integrity involving mirroring, ≤1X for parity data integrity. Explanation [here](http://www.raid-calculator.com/raid-types-reference.aspx).

The sum of all 3 "X" factors above is how much total raw storage you'll need relative to your source data.
