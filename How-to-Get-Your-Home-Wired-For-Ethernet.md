For most places in the US this will cost <1% of your home's value (less than 2 mortgage payments); even less if you DIY (**WARNING:** Poor DIY that damages your house's appearance can cost you more in lost resale value than a professional installation). **If you can afford your mortgage payment, you can save enough to get your house wired.**
