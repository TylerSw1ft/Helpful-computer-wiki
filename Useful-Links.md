# Aquantia

## Drivers

[Marvell acquired Aquantia in late 2019](https://www.marvell.com/company/newsroom/marvell-completes-acquisition-of-aquantia.html), and so drivers are now found at the Marvell website. Unfortunately, they haven't made it easy to find support or drivers for legacy Aquantia products. To do so:

1. Find your Aquantia NIC part number
2. Go [here](https://www.marvell.com/support/downloads.html#) and filter by your OS and the part number from 1) above

You should find the driver download there. From what I've seen in various forum threads, the direct from the OEM driver update typically fixes link rate/stability issues.

# Backup

## Strategy

### How many copies of data are needed

[3-2-1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/wiki/backups#wiki_the_3-2-1_strategy)

### How to select HDD capacity

Buy the largest capacity HDDs per bay or slot you can afford. Unit storage cost isn't a bad metric, but as fleet size grows, footprint costs begin to dominate. For example, it's less expensive in the long run to have 1 machine with 4x16 TB HDDs than 4 machines with 4x4 TB HDDs each. See the *Retiring Pods* section [here](https://www.soothsawyer.com/ryan-smith-uses-backblazes-smart-data-to-illustrate-the-power-of-data/) for a case study.

##### as MyUsername

1. Complete 1) of **as root** instructions
2. Kill the `rslsync` process
3. Copy `.sync` from `/bin` to `~/`
4. Change the permissions and ownership of the `.sync` copy to grant MyUsername `rwx` and ownership
5. Start Resilio Sync by running `cd /bin && ./rslsync --storage /absolute/path/to/home/.sync/folder` ([Source](https://forum.resilio.com/topic/71858-linuxbsd-how-do-i-move-sync-from-running-as-root-to-running-as-my-user-without-having-to-setup-from-scratch/?do=findComment&comment=153863))

6. Run `./rslsync --storage /absolute/path/to/home/.sync/folder` to start `rslsync`

## FuryBSD

Note: FuryBSD was discontinued in Q3 2020. Because FuryBSD is just an installation image that includes an integrated DE with the FreeBSD base install, it's really just FreeBSD once the installation is complete. This means you can still use it to get to the latest FreeBSD release by installing [the latest image](https://sourceforge.net/projects/furybsd/files/12.1-2020Q3-KDE/) and then updating the OS in-place.

* [Installation](https://github.com/furybsd/furybsd-handbook/wiki/Installing-FuryBSD)
* [Live USB creation](https://github.com/furybsd/furybsd-livecd/wiki)

## Why I might no longer run BSD

TL,DR: it's too much trouble.

* I need a DE. This eliminates NetBSD and Dragonfly BSD
* I need native ZFS support. This eliminates OpenBSD
* I need proper rc.d support. This eliminates GhostBSD, which uses OpenRC
  * I used GhostBSD for around 2 months, but eventually dropped it due to limited features (MATE is about as useless a DE as you can imagine) and stuff just not working reliably. The latter included, but it not limited to
    * I couldn't get 3rd party services to start reliably at boot. I wound up having to use an `@reboot` crontab entry as a workaround, but of course that doesn't help if the service crashes
    * I couldn't get NFS shares to mount reliably at boot, even with an `@reboot` crontab entry, or to mount at all otherwise at times
* FuryBSD is a major PITA to set up
* Instant Workstation for FreeBSD is unreliable (on legacy hardware)

# Ethernet

## How to connect pre-wired Ethernet ports

Situation: you find out your home has been prewired for Ethernet. How do you use the ports to connect your devices?

1. Each Ethernet wall port should be fed by an Ethernet cable run from the port to a central location. That central location, which we'll call a junction box, is usually in the basement, a closet, the attic, or in the garage. **Locate the patch panel before you move in and place items that might make it harder to find**
2. Determine which Category (5, 5E, 6, 6A, 7, 7A, or 8) of cable you have. It is usually printed along the length of the cables. This will determine your network's top (theoretical) speed. Cat 5 is good for 100 Mb/s, 5E & above for 1 Gb/s, Cat 6A & above for 10 Gb/s, and Cat 8 for 20 Gb/s
3. If the cables aren not yet terminated (read: if they do not end in a male or female Ethernet jack), terminate them with a [patch panel](https://community.fs.com/blog/what-is-a-patch-panel-and-why-use-it.html). You can either DIY this or have a structured cabling contractor do it for you
4. Use [cable testing tools](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/wiki/Recommended-Hardware#testers) to match the cables at the patch panel with other terminations in the home
5. Connect your router (or switch downstream of your router) to the patch panel ports that have matches in the previous step

If there is no junction box in step 1, then detach the wall plates from the wall and ensure they're being fed by Ethernet cable. If they aren't, then consider [these options](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/wiki/Useful-Links#improvement). If they are, then your cabling may be point-to-point. Locate all cable terminations in the home and test them round-robin with the testing tools from Step 4, making notes as you go along to match ports with each other. A network connection can be established between any 2 matching port pairs. If you're unable to find any matching pairs, then your cables are *somewhere* that's not a junction box. Scour all closets, attics, cupboards, basements, sheds, and garages. Use the tracing probe to help. If you still can't find where your cables are going, contact a structured cabling contractor to see what's going on.

## 4Kn vs. 512e

4Kn and 512e drives have the same performance except for when they are used with 512n apps and OSes. In that case, 4Kn HDDs have no support, while 512e HDDs suffer a read-modify-write performance penalty *relative to 512n HDDs*.

In other words, a 512e HDD is a 4Kn HDD with backwards compatibility with 512n apps and OSes. 

Per an anonymous Seagate engineering source, 512e HDDs outsell 4Kn HDDs by a wide margin among datacenter and hyperscale customers.

## How to tell if an HDD is SMR 

* Windows: `Trim` should be listed under `Features` for the HDD in CrystalDiskInfo
* Linux: `TRIM` should be listed under `Commands/features:` in the output of `# hdparm -I /dev/DiskName`

## Power consumption

How to calculate HDD max power consumption (you will need the HDD user manual to find the needed input data): 

### Method 1

This is the easiest method, but it is conservative and therefore may unrealistically overestimate power usage by adding the max powers for each voltage under different conditions that are unlikely to occur simultanously:

1. Find the input voltages (usually 5 VDC and 12 VDC)
2. Multiply each input voltage by its maximum corresponding current value
3. Sum all the results of 2) above. 

[Example](https://www.seagate.com/files/www-content/product-content/enterprise-hdd-fam/exos-x18/_shared/en-us/docs/100865854a.pdf) (p. 12, Table 6):

`Max Power = (5 VDC *1.22 A) + (12 VDC *2.88 A) = 40.66 W`

### Method 2

1. Same as above
2. Multiple each input voltage by each listed corresponding current
3. Sum the results of the above *per condition*. Using the previous example, sum the 5 VDC and 12 VDC powers (voltage x current) for each line in Table 6 separately
4. Pick the highest result from Step 3

## Recovery

1. If the HDD is in an enclosure, shuck it and connect it to a SATA dock or (preferably) an internal SATA port. If the HDD is already internal, try it on or in a different PC.
2. If the host OS detects the HDD as newly connected in 1) above, copy all the data off it. If the OS does not detect the drive, you'll need a professional data recovery service.

### How to set up and customize Bash 

Per this [reference](https://shreevatsa.wordpress.com/2008/03/30/zshbash-startup-files-loading-order-bashrc-zshrc-etc/), interactive login shells (e.g. SSH) read from `~/.bash_profile`, while interactive non-login shells (e.g. terminal window) read from `~/.bashrc`. OpenIndiana lacks a default `~/.bash_profile`, so create that first using `touch .bash_profile`.

Put the following in `.bash_profile` and then save it:

```
# Point .bash_profile to .bashrc if Bash is the current shell

# If running bash
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    # Include .bashrc if it exists
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
	. "$HOME/.bashrc"
    fi
fi
```

An example of `.bashrc` file is shown below:

```
#
# Define default prompt to <username>@<hostname>:<path><"($|#) ">
# and print '#' for user "root" and '$' for normal users.
#

# Standardized Bash prompt: https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/issues/113
typeset +x PS1="\[\033[01;32m\]\u\[\033[01;34m\]@\h \[\033[35m\]\D{%F %T}\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ "

# Useful aliases
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
# alias dir='dir --color=auto'
# alias vdir='vdir --color=auto'

# alias grep='grep --color=auto'
# alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
# alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'

alias ll='ls -l'
alias la='ls -A'
alias l='ls -CF'

# for setting history length see HISTSIZE and HISTFILESIZE in bash(1)
export HISTSIZE=1000
export HISTFILESIZE=2000
export HISTTIMEFORMAT='%F %T '

shopt -s histappend

# Tell OS where to find packages
export PATH="/usr/gnu/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/opt/local/sbin:/opt/local/bin:$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:/opt/local/sbin:/opt/local/bin:$PATH"

# Tell OS where to find man pages
export MANPATH=/opt/local/man:/usr/gnu/share/man:/usr/share/man:/usr/X11/share/man:$MANPATH

# Set default editor
export EDITOR=nano
```

If your history isn't persistent across sessions, change ownership of `.bash_history` to yourself via `# chown YourUsername .bash_history`. Your history settings should follow this format (the last line should always be there):

```
export HISTSIZE=1000
export HISTFILESIZE=2000
export HISTTIMEFORMAT='%F %T '

shopt -s histappend
```

To customize your root shells, repeat the same process for `/root/.bash_profile` (create it if it doesn't exist) and `/root/.bashrc`.

Log out and login again (via SSH or locally) to force your changes to take effect and test them.

## Maintenance

How to keep your Windows installation healthy over the years without ever having to reinstall

### Do

* Ensure the latest *stable* BIOS and driver releases are installed. You can subscribe to email or RSS notifications from many OEMs
* Install updates as soon as they are offered for your PC
* Ensure the latest application releases are installed
* Be patient

### Don't

* Run unsupported configurations
* Edit the Windows registry directly unless it's for a mission critical feature
* Enable optional features (under `Turn Windows Features On or Off`) unless they are mission critical
* Install beta drivers unless they are mission critical or they address a mission critical bug
* Use Windows customizers
* Force updates on machines for whom the update hasn't been offered via Microsoft Update
* Delete your recovery partition
* Multiboot. Aside from Boot Camp, Windows is neither developed nor tested for this
* Be impatient, such as turning off your computer during an update unless it's stalled for literally 24 hours

#### How to create a Storage Pool using PowerShell

Use this method if you're getting weird errors creating a storage pool in Control Panel's Storage Spaces GUI.

**WARNING:** Be careful when copying and pasting PowerShell code as sometimes important characters such as dashes or quotes get removed during the operation. Why? Your guess is as good as mine.

This example assumes you'll be using all poolable drives in your storage pool.

1. Ensure the target drives are not part of a DrivePool or any similar volume spanning solution. If they are, remove them from the spanned volume or DrivePool
2. Delete any volumes on the target drives in Windows Disk Management
3. If it's not installed already, download and install the latest stable [PowerShell release](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases)
4. Run PowerShell as Administrator
5. Find out if your target target drives can be pooled by running `Get-PhysicalDisk` and checking the `Can Pool` column value. If it's `True`, skip to Step 8. If it's `False`:
6. Run `Reset-PhysicalDisk -FriendlyName "PhysicalDiskn"` for each drive, where `n` is the number in the `Number` column of `Get-PhysicalDisk`'s output in Step 5
7. Reboot the PC
8. Run `Get-StoragePool -IsPrimordial $true | Get-PhysicalDisk | Where-Object CanPool -eq $True`. The output should be the drives you reset in Step 6, e.g.

```
PS C:\Windows\System32> Get-StoragePool -IsPrimordial $true | Get-PhysicalDisk | Where-Object CanPool -eq $True

Number FriendlyName         SerialNumber MediaType CanPool OperationalStatus HealthStatus Usage           Size
------ ------------         ------------ --------- ------- ----------------- ------------ -----           ----
0      ST12000NM0007-2A1101 12345678     HDD       True    OK                Healthy      Auto-Select 10.91 TB
1      ST12000DM0007-2GR116 87654321     HDD       True    OK                Healthy      Auto-Select 10.91 TB
```

9. Run [`Get-StorageSubsystem`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/storage/get-storagesubsystem?view=win10-ps), e.g.

```
PS C:\Windows\System32>  Get-StorageSubSystem

FriendlyName                     HealthStatus OperationalStatus
------------                     ------------ -----------------
StorageSubsystemFriendlyNameString Healthy      OK
```

10. Create the storage pool by running `New-StoragePool -FriendlyName YourDesiredPoolName -StorageSubsystemFriendlyName 'StorageSubsystemFriendlyNameString' -PhysicalDisks (Get-PhysicalDisk -CanPool $True)`. Alternatively, if you want to use a specified subset of the eligible disks, run a command of the form `New-StoragePool –FriendlyName YourDesiredCamelCasePoolName –StorageSubsystemFriendlyName 'StorageSubsystemFriendlyNameString' –PhysicalDisks (Get-PhysicalDisk PhysicalDiska, PhysicalDiskb, PhysicalDiskc)`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` have the same definiton as `n` in Step 6

Your storage pool should now be created, and you can create storage spaces on it using Control Panel's Storage Spaces GUI.

[Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/storage-spaces/deploy-standalone-storage-spaces#windows-powershell-equivalent-commands-for-creating-storage-pools) (Good luck understanding it.)

#### How to create a Storage Space using PowerShell

The following will create a single column, 2-way mirror storage space that consumes all the available space on the pool using the same parameters as above:

1. Open an elevated PowerShell prompt
2. Run `New-VirtualDisk -StoragePoolFriendlyName YourDesiredPoolName -FriendlyName YourDesiredVirtualDiskName -ResiliencySettingName Mirror -NumberOfDataCopies 2 -ProvisioningType Fixed -UseMaximumSize -NumberOfColumns 1 -Verbose`

Note that `-UseMaximumSize` cannot be invoked with `-ProvisioningType Thin` spaces, as thin spaces dynamically expand *in situ* with storage demand.

Confirm that the virtual disk has been created as specified:

```
PS C:\Windows\System32> Get-VirtualDisk

FriendlyName ResiliencySettingName FaultDomainRedundancy OperationalStatus HealthStatus     Size FootprintOnPool StorageEfficiency
------------ --------------------- --------------------- ----------------- ------------     ---- --------------- -----------------
YourDesiredVirtualDiskName  Mirror                1                     OK                Healthy      10.91 TB        21.82 TB            50.00%
```

To create a volume on the storage space, simply open Disk Manager. You'll get a prompt to initialize the new disk you created. Initialize it as GPT and then proceed to create a volume on it as you would otherwise. You then need to enable [ReFS integrity streams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/refs/integrity-streams) on the volume via `Set-FileIntegrity H:\ -Enable $True`. Do not forget this step as otherwise ReFS will not have data checksumming, which is pretty much the #1 reason to use it instead of NTFS.

#### How to extend an ReFS volume

The information available on this is sparse and a bit confusing, but basically it appears you can only expand volumes by 20% at time. This just means it will take multiple expansions when you add new disks. Threads on the subject:

#### How to upgrade a storage pool

See [Option 2](https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/83868-upgrade-storage-pool-storage-spaces-windows-10-a.html). I'd recommend you run this command after every semi annual Windows release, as ReFS/Storage Pool updates are delivered with Windows releases.

# NFS

For v4:

## Debian Stable Server, FreeBSD RELEASE Client

### Server

`# apt install nfs-kernel-server`

#### `/etc/exports`

Needs the following line:

`/Path/To/Shared/Folder ClientIPAddressOrHostname(rw,async,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)`

Restart the NFS server to load your changes: `# systemctl restart nfs-kernel-server`

### Client

#### Terminal

`# mount -t nfs -o nfsv4 ServerIPAddress:/PathToServerShare /LocalMountPath`

#### `/etc/fstab`

Needs the following line:

`ServerIPAddress:/PathToServerShare  /LocalMountPath                     nfs     rw,nfsv4acls    0 0`

## OpenIndiana Hipster Server, Raspberry Pi OS Stable Client

Assuming `rpool1` is pool to be shared:

### Server

#### Terminal

Run the following command:

`# zfs set sharenfs='rw=@ClientIPAddress/32,root=@ClientIPAddress/32' rpool1`

There is no need to restart anything after running that command; the OS automatically applies the settings and publishes the new share with them.

### [Client](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/nfs.md)

See **Set up an NFSv4 client** heading at the above link.

`# apt install nfs-common`

#### Terminal

`# mount -t nfs -o proto=tcp,port=2049 ServerIPAddress:/ /LocalMountPath`

#### `/etc/fstab`

Needs the following line:

`ServerIPAddress:/   /mnt   nfs    auto  0  0`

## DRAID (Distributed RAID)

* [Some details about how DRAID works](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/svcstorwize/entry/Some_details_about_how_DRAID_works?lang=en)

> Distributed RAID was launched in 7.6.0 and allows a RAID5 or RAID6 array to be distributed over a larger set of drives. Previously if you created a RADI5 array over 8 drives, the data was striped across them with each stripe having a data strip on 7 of the drives and a parity strip on the 8th. In distributed RAID5 you specify the stripe width and the number of drives separately so you can still have 7 data strips protected by a parity strip but those 8 drives are selected from 64. On top of that we added distributed sparing, this is the idea that instead of having a spare sat on the side that isn't being used, each drive in the array gives up some of its capacity to make a spare.

Task names are both unique *and* persistent. What the latter means is that *even if you delete a task*, if you create another task with the same name it will inherit all the history (and behavior!!!) of the deleted task. 

Often, the best fix for a malfunctioning task is to completely delete it, then recreate it from scratch directly on the target machine using a different unique task name.

# Speed tests

## [DSLReports.com](http://www.dslreports.com/speedtest)

* This is the premier, most realistic internet connection diagnostic test online
* Run this test on a wired connection to your router or modem, if you can. **Tests run on wireless connections are inconclusive due to the basic physics limitations of Wi-Fi**
* If you were sent to this link from a discussion thread containing a problem you're having, **please post your results (link on the results page) back in the thread. Doing so will help users on the thread diagnose your issues. The quality of the advice you receive is directly proportional to the quality of the information you provide**

### How to fix scores

≥ A: Nothing to worry about for Bufferbloat or Quality

#### [Bufferbloat](https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/)

In the downstream direction:

1. Check your modem's specifications to ensure it can handle the connection speed you're paying for. If you're on a cable connection, you should have a DOCSIS 3.1 modem at the very least. If not, get a [new modem](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/wiki/Recommended-Hardware#modems)
2. Flash your existing router with [DD-WRT](https://dd-wrt.com/), if [supported](https://dd-wrt.com/support/router-database/) 
   * **WARNING:** 
     * Although DD-WRT supports SQM, DD-WRT itself may not be stable or performant on your particular router
     * Flashing 3rd party firmware may cause other issues with your router. If you are not willing to work around, [report](https://forum.dd-wrt.com/phpBB2/), and debug these [issues](https://svn.dd-wrt.com/), do Option 2 below instead
     * DD-WRT builds may have been tested with your router's chipset, but not necessarily with your exact router model
2. Get a new [standalone wired](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/wiki/Recommended-Hardware#standalone-routers) (you will need a separate [wireless AP](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/wiki/Recommended-Hardware#access-points) if you choose this) or [combo wired + wireless](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/wiki/Recommended-Hardware#routers) router with a faster CPU and more RAM. A router that supports later specs and/or higher speeds will typically fulfill this 

#### Quality

Quality scores are typically indicative of internet connection signal strength at your modem (from your ISP). Unfortunately, most of the time this not something you can fix on your own. Contact your ISP, describing your symptoms, and tell them your modem (or ONT, if you have a fiber connection) may be experiencing low signal strength. They may either send a tech out for an onsite visit or  otherwise fix the problem remotely via changes upstream of your modem. If you are indeed experiencing low signal strength and/or the issue is on their end most ISPs will not charge for the onsite visit.

A typical "good" signal strength for cable modems is somewhere between +/- 7 dB.

### Still having problems despite OK scores

Try using a VPN with an endpoint in a major city nearby or in a major city near the datacenter of the service you're trying to use. 

## Speedtest.net

Good indicator of ping; some ISPs don't like it because they think it underestimates speed.

[Speedtest Global Index](https://www.speedtest.net/global-index): Good way of seeing how fast your connection is compared to the average in your country and worldwide. The further below your country or worldwide aveage your connection speed is, the more likely you are to have problems.

## Your ISP

e.g. [Mediacom Cable Speed Test](http://speedtest.mediacomtoday.com/)

This is the speedtest your ISP is most likely to believe. They're not entirely wrong; the other tests have a lot of variables the ISP arguably has no control over. However, if your results here are frequently significantly lower than what you pay for, you certainly have grounds to contact your ISP about it.

[The Ars Technica semi-scientific guide to Wi-Fi Access Point placement](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/02/the-ars-technica-semi-scientific-guide-to-wi-fi-access-point-placement/)

The above article also explains that mesh wireless systems underperform under heavy network load (one of the problems they are marketed as solving.) FTA:

>  Under heavy network load, cheap wired access points like Ubiquiti UAP-AC-Lites or TP-Link EAP-225v3s absolutely smoke even the best mesh kits, if the mesh kits are limited to Wi-Fi backhaul only.

### Using a Router as an AP

**The below also applies to using a router as the downstream half of a wirless bridge**.

Do NOT do this, because most consumer routers become unreachable from the LAN when in AP mode. As such, if you want to change *any* setting at all, you have to factory reset the router and set up AP mode from scratch with your desired setting

Also, if router's Wi-Fi speed rating is less than AC1750, its performance in modern wireless environments is going to be awful.

## Physical blocking

If you have multipe APs and want 1 of the APs to be *exclusively* (read: clients cannot see any other AP) acessible only within a defined space, you can [Faraday Cage](https://hackaday.com/2018/09/26/building-a-hardware-store-faraday-cage/) that space.

## Range

### Improvement

As a general rule, the fewer wireless client devices you have, the better your wireless performance will be.

The following are ways to improve your wireless range, from best to worst:

1. Run Ethernet (copper or fiber) cable. Fiber is has a faster theoretical max speed, but is more brittle, requires more expensive gear, has very little client device support, cannot carry power, and has fewer capable installers. Copper cable generally has lower theoretical speeds, but has none of fiber's disadvantages. Generally speaking, unless you need network speeds in excess of 10 Gb/s, stick to Cat 6A or Cat 8 copper cable. **DO NOT USE Cat 7 AS IT IS NOT A TIA STANDARD**. There are several ways to do run cable, all of which can be combined with each other:
   1. Run naked cable along the walls (in the seams between the wall and floor, floor and ceiling, or multiple walls). Use cord protectors to get the cable across foot traffic pathways, such as across doorways. **OPTIONAL**: use cable stables to attach the cable to the wall
      1. Advantages:
         1. Least expensive option
         2. Same performance as other more expensive options
         3. Easy reconfiguration
         4. If no cable staples are used, no alteration of building structure necessary (good for renters)
         5. No plenum rated cable required
      2. Disadvantages:
         1. Some people find exposed Ethernet cable and even cord protectors aesthetically unattractive
         2. Cables not in cord protectors or in unsecured cord protectors may be tripped over
         3. Cables not in cord protectors may be damaged by foot traffic, pets, children, etc.
         4. Extreme cable lengths may be needed for some runs, especially for larger homes
         5. High probability of cable tangles
         6. Secured non-velcro cord protectors need adhesive to stay put, which may damage flooring and carpeting
         7. Velcro cord protectors do not work on cut-pile carpet or non-carpet surfaces
         8. Wall alteration if cable staples are used
   2. Same as above, but adding cable raceways to hide the cable in the seams and route it around pathways
      1. Advantages:
         1. Some people find it more attractive than running naked cable
         2. Cables less likely to be damaged than if they were naked
         3. Same performance as more expensive options
         4. Lower probability of cable tangles
         5. No plenum rated cable required
         6. If no cable stables are used, no structural alteration to house needed if raceways aren't attached to the wall
      1. Disadvantages:
         1. Some people find raceways just as aesthetically unattractive as naked cable
         2. Raceways will be loose unless they are attached to the wall
         3. Attaching raceways to the wall might structurally alter the building (not good for renters)
         4. The combined thickness of cables on a given route may be too large for the raceway
         5. Wall alteration if cable staples are used
   3. [Internally wire your home for Ethernet](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/wiki/How-to-Get-Your-Home-Wired-For-Ethernet)
      1. Advantages:
         1. Most aesthetically attractive option
         2. More direct route to clients means shorter runs
         3. Lowest probability of cable tangles
         4. Adds value to your home (if properly finished)
         5. Minimizes need for cord protectors and raceways
      2. Disadvantages 
         1. Requires cutting into the walls of the building (not for renters)
         2. Most expensive option, even if you DIY
         3. Can reduce the value of your home if finished poorly (professional installation is a good investment)
         4. Needs special plenum-rated cable for runs routed through air ducting for fire safety
2. Use [MoCA adapters](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/wiki/Recommended-Hardware#moca-adapters). If you don't have an RG6 coax outlet available where you need MoCA, then either run Ethernet cable (preferred), run RG6 coax cable, or see one of the following options. Any structural cabling or electrical contractor can run RG6 cable for you
3. Get a better [combo router](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/wiki/Recommended-Hardware#routers) or AP (see previous AP link)
4. Use Powerline adapters. **WARNING:** Powerline adapters are very susceptible to noise and far less reliable than MoCA and Ethernet. If you do not have an electrical outlet nearby, then - in order of descending preference - run Ethernet cable, run coax cable, or install an electrical outlet. You will most likely need a licensed electrician for the outlet option for your own immediate safety and long term fire/electric shock safety of your home
5. **LAST RESORT:** Deploy a wireless backhaul (communication between the satellite and base station) mesh network. **WARNING:** Mesh networks come with their own issues and are [incredibly painful to troubleshoot](https://www.reddit.com/r/HomeNetworking/comments/h9r7se/ping_spikes_on_alternating_packets/)

For the Ethernet, MoCA, and Powerline solutions: depending on your situation you can either connect the long range client via direct cabling or place a [switch](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/wiki/Recommended-Hardware#switches) + [standalone AP](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/wiki/Recommended-Hardware#access-points) there. You can also use deploy a mesh network using the Ethernet, MoCA, or Powerline cabling for backhaul.

**NEVER** deploy a wireless extender; it will absolutely destroy your Wi-Fi performance.
