[OEM support windows](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/gd35u6/are_we_and_all_the_tech_reviewers_counting/fpg32oe/)

## Developer Options

### Minimum Width

#### [Convert dp units to pixel units](https://developer.android.com/training/multiscreen/screendensities.html#dips-pels)

`px = dp(dpi/160)`

`dp = 160px/dpi`

* Use [DisplayInfo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.gerdavax.displayinfo) to find `dpi`
* `px` is display horizontal resolution

## Kernel

### Updates

[Android devices do NOT receive kernel version updates (see Paragraph 3)](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/11/google-outlines-plans-for-mainline-linux-kernel-support-in-android/)

### Why ARM requires per-device kernel builds (and x86 doesn't)

## LineageOS

### How to determine upstream AOSP security patch status

Search the page at the following URL for “security string” :

`https://github.com/LineageOS/android_build/blob/lineage-X.Y/core/version_defaults.mk`

Where `X.Y` is the LineageOS version you’re using, e.g. 16.0. You should see a date which corresponds to an upstream Android patch date.

## Strategy

### How many copies of data are needed

[3-2-1](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/wiki/backups#wiki_the_3-2-1_strategy)

### How to select HDD capacity

Buy the largest capacity HDDs per bay or slot you can afford. Unit storage cost isn't a bad metric, but as fleet size grows, footprint costs begin to dominate. For example, it's less expensive in the long run to have 1 machine with 4x16 TB HDDs than 4 machines with 4x4 TB HDDs each. See the *Retiring Pods* section [here](https://www.soothsawyer.com/ryan-smith-uses-backblazes-smart-data-to-illustrate-the-power-of-data/) for a case study.

### Resilio Sync

#### How to set up

1. Download the FreeBSD archive from the Resilio Sync website
2. Extract the FreeBSD archive
3. Place the `rslsync` binary in `/bin`

##### as root

1. Start Resilio Sync by running `cd /bin && sudo ./rslsync`
2. To run Resilio Sync at boot, add the following entry to `/etc/crontab`: `@reboot root cd /bin && ./rslsync`

##### as MyUsername

1. Complete 1) of **as root** instructions
2. Kill the `rslsync` process
3. Copy `.sync` from `/bin` to `~/`
4. Change the permissions and ownership of the `.sync` copy to grant MyUsername `rwx` and ownership
5. Start Resilio Sync by running `cd /bin && ./rslsync --storage /absolute/path/to/home/.sync/folder` ([Source](https://forum.resilio.com/topic/71858-linuxbsd-how-do-i-move-sync-from-running-as-root-to-running-as-my-user-without-having-to-setup-from-scratch/?do=findComment&comment=153863))
6. To run Resilio Sync at boot, add the following entry to `/etc/crontab`: `@reboot MyUsername cd /bin && ./rslsync --storage /absolute/path/to/home/.sync/folder`

#### How to update

##### as MyUsername

1. Download the new archive
2. Extract the new archive
3. Kill the `rslsync` process
4. Overwrite `/bin/rslsync` with the binary extracted in 2)
5. Run `# chmod +x /bin/rslsync`
6. Run `./rslsync --storage /absolute/path/to/home/.sync/folder` to start `rslsync`

## Why I might no longer run BSD

TL,DR: it's too much trouble.

* I need a DE. This eliminates NetBSD and Dragonfly BSD
* I need native ZFS support. This eliminates OpenBSD
* I need proper rc.d support. This eliminates GhostBSD, which uses OpenRC
  * I used GhostBSD for around 2 months, but eventually dropped it due to limited features (MATE is about as useless a DE as you can imagine) and stuff just not working reliably. The latter included, but it not limited to
    * I couldn't get 3rd party services to start reliably at boot. I wound up having to use an `@reboot` crontab entry as a workaround, but of course that doesn't help if the service crashes
    * I couldn't get NFS shares to mount reliably at boot, even with an `@reboot` crontab entry, or to mount at all otherwise at times
* FuryBSD is a major PITA to set up
* Instant Workstation for FreeBSD is unreliable (on legacy hardware)

However, for hard disk drives working in the 4K native mode, there is no emulation layer in place, and the disk media directly exposes its 4096, 4112, 4160, or 4224-byte physical sector size to the system firmware and operating system.

## Maintenance

How to keep your Windows installation healthy over the years without ever having to reinstall

### Do

* Ensure the latest *stable* BIOS and driver releases are installed. You can subscribe to email or RSS notifications from many OEMs
* Install updates as soon as they are offered for your PC
* Ensure the latest application releases are installed
* Be patient

### Don't

* Run unsupported configurations
* Edit the Windows registry directly unless it's for a mission critical feature
* Enable optional features (under `Turn Windows Features On or Off`) unless they are mission critical
* Install beta drivers unless they are mission critical or they address a mission critical bug
* Use Windows customizers
* Force updates on machines for whom the update hasn't been offered via Microsoft Update
* Delete your recovery partition
* Multiboot. Aside from Boot Camp, Windows is neither developed nor tested for this
* Be impatient, such as turning off your computer during an update unless it's stalled for literally 24 hours

## DRAID (Distributed RAID)

* [Some details about how DRAID works](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/svcstorwize/entry/Some_details_about_how_DRAID_works?lang=en)

> Distributed RAID was launched in 7.6.0 and allows a RAID5 or RAID6 array to be distributed over a larger set of drives. Previously if you created a RADI5 array over 8 drives, the data was striped across them with each stripe having a data strip on 7 of the drives and a parity strip on the 8th. In distributed RAID5 you specify the stripe width and the number of drives separately so you can still have 7 data strips protected by a parity strip but those 8 drives are selected from 64. On top of that we added distributed sparing, this is the idea that instead of having a spare sat on the side that isn't being used, each drive in the array gives up some of its capacity to make a spare.
