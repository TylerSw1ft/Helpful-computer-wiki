### Access Points

If you don't absolutely need an AP right now, wait for Ubiquity UniFi Wi-Fi 6 APs before buying. Also, bear in mind you'll need UniFi Controller for all of the following. If you want to run Controller on standalone hardware, I recommend Debian 10 on a Craigslist PC or Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi 4.
