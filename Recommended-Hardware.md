### Access Points

If you don't absolutely need an AP right now, wait for Ubiquity UniFi Wi-Fi 6 APs before buying. Also, bear in mind you'll need UniFi Controller for all of the following. If you want to run Controller on standalone hardware, I recommend Debian 10 on a [used PC](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware#what-are-the-minimum-specs-you-recommend-for-any-used-pc) or Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi 4. 

In order of increasing performance and client density:
