Note: I haven't used everything on this list. Some of these products are simply what I consider to be the best or best value for money in their category.

### Unmanaged

Assuming they have the specs and features you want, *always* buy NETGEAR Business for unmanaged switches. Other brands are nowhere near as reliable and NETGEAR's warranty and support are the best in the business.

* [Hitron HT-EM2](http://www.hitron-americas.com/product/ht-em2/) (Difficult to find at retail; check service provider)

### Standalone Routers

The following routers offer enterprise level performance, line speed routing in specs, and easy OpenVPN functionality while still covering consumer features such as UPnP.

* [Netgate SG-3100 & Above](https://store.netgate.com/Assets/Images/ChartsTables/Netgate_Hardware_Comparison_Chart.png)
* [NETGEAR BR200 Insight Instant VPN Router](https://www.netgear.com/images/datasheet/security/BR200.pdf)

## Wireless 

### Access points

The following AP is coming soon and may replace all the recommendations below:

[Ubiquiti UniFi 6 Long-Range Access Point](http://dl-origin.ubnt.com/ds/u6-lr_ds.pdf)

#### High performance

You'll need UniFi Controller for all of the following. If you want to run Controller on standalone hardware, I recommend ~~Debian 10 on a [used PC](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware#what-are-the-minimum-specs-you-recommend-for-any-used-pc) or~~Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi 4. 

##### 802.11ac

In order of increasing performance and client density:

* [Ubiquiti UniFi AP HD](https://www.ubnt.com/downloads/datasheets/unifi/UniFi_UAP-AC-HD_DS.pdf)
* [Ubiquiti UniFi AP SHD](https://dl.ubnt.com/datasheets/unifi/UniFi_UAP-AC-SHD_DS.pdf)
* [Ubiquiti UniFi AP XG](https://dl.ubnt.com/datasheets/unifi/UniFi_XG_AP_DS.pdf)

#### Value

If you absolutely need to save money or better Windows support than what UniFi Controller offers:

[TP-Link EAP245 V3](https://www.tp-link.com/us/business-networking/ceiling-mount-access-point/eap245/v3/) + [Omada Software Controller](https://www.tp-link.com/us/business-networking/ceiling-mount-access-point/eap-controller/) + [Omada app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tplink.omada)

(Wi-Fi 6)

**CAUTION**: Although Wi-Fi Alliance certification for this has begun, the standard has not yet been finalized by the IEEE. Buy products at your own risk.

In the router/AP's Wi-Fi Alliance Wi-Fi 6 certificate, the following should be in the:

1. **Security** section:
   1. WPA3™ - Personal
2. **Wi-Fi CERTIFIED 6™** section:
   1. OFDMA
      1. DL OFDMA
      2. UL OFDMA
   2. MU-MIMO
   3. Maximum Supported Channel Width (20, 40, 80, 160 MHz)
   4. Target Wake Time (TWT)
   5. MCS 10-11 Rx (= 1024-QAM)
   6. Beamforming

[ASUS RT-AX88U](https://www.asus.com/us/Networking/RT-AX88U/) - ([Wi-Fi 6 Certificate](http://certifications.prod.wi-fi.org/pdf/certificate/public/download?cid=WFA91821))

##### 802.11ac

**WARNING**: The following products [canNOT be guaranteed](https://github.com/jdrch/Hardware/wiki/Useful-Links#bufferbloat) to not be affected by Bufferbloat.

* [TP-Link Archer C8](https://www.tp-link.com/us/home-networking/wifi-router/archer-c8/) (WARNING: Firmware updates factory reset this router, and it typically locks up or needs a power cycle about once every 2 to 3 months)
* [NETGEAR R6400 AC1750 Smart WiFi Router](https://www.netgear.com/home/products/networking/wifi-routers/R6400.aspx)
* [NETGEAR R6700 Nighthawk AC1750 Smart WiFi Router](https://www.netgear.com/home/products/networking/wifi-routers/R6700.aspx) (NOTE: Despite the higher model number, get the R6400 above instead if it's available)

**WARNING**: The following product is less likely to be affected by Bufferbloat than the previous ones due to its Linux kernel version (3.x), but that cannot be guaranteed

# Scanners

## Automatic Document Feed (ADF)/Flatbed

For some reason, it's become incredibly difficult to find highly rated (≥ 4 ⭐) ADF + flatbed scanners. However, the following model comes the closest of all (the affordable ones) I've seen:

# Scrapers

## Cloud

The only providers I recommend are (in alphabetical order):

* Amazon
* Backblaze
* Dropbox
* Google
* Microsoft

## HDDs

Generally speaking, all HDDs that lack a workload rating have the same reliability. The only 2.5 in HDDs with workload ratings are ≥ 15 mm thick, which means they consume (nearly) as much space as a 3.5 in HDD. Also, I have no experience with the former. Ergo, they are omitted here.

### 3.5 in

Get the 512e models of these, or the 4Kn models if the former are unavailable. Do NOT buy 512n:

## SATA controller cards (non-RAID)

### Throughput needs

The following are based on the highest known (to me) specified throughput values. Check the specs of the disks you're intending to connect to the controller card for their throughput values. To avoid bottlenecking, ensure the selected card's throughput per port exceeds your disks' maximum individual throughput.

* HDDs: ≥ 270 MB/s (estimated)
* SSDs: ≥ 550 MB/s (estimated)
  * AFAIK no SATA controller supports this much throughput per port. Users intending to use SSDs should probably use a higher end HBA instead
* SATA 3.0: 750 MB/s
  * The above comment for SSDs applies 

#### How to calculate throughput per port

1. Look up the **Throughput** value corresponding to the card's **PCI Express version** and lane count (x*n*, where *n* is an integer) in the **PCI Express link performance** table [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCI_Express#History_and_revisions)
2. Divide the result in 1) by the number of ports on the card

Always select the highest PCI Express version (1.0, 2.0, etc.) for your available slot (x1, x2, etc.) *OR*, if you have multiple available slots, the PCI Expression version + slot width combination that gives you the highest throughput in the **PCI Express link performance table** in 1) above.

### PCI Express version + lane count combinations to avoid

The following combinations might bottleneck the connected disks and should be avoided unless there are no other options:

* 1.0 x1,2
* 2.0 x1

### Cards

#### PCI Express 2.0 x4

* [High Point Rocket 640L](https://highpoint-tech.com/USA_new/series_r600-overview.htm) (4 ports, 500 MB/s/port)
* [SYBA 4 Port SAS/SATA 6Gbps PCI-e 2.0 x4 Card - SY-PEX40096](https://www.sybausa.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=64_181_85&product_id=827&filter=38,19,188&sort=p.price&order=ASC&limit=32) (500 MB/s/port)
  * The "PCIe 2.0 Host Interface (up to 5.0 Gbps)" on the product page appears to be a typo; PCI Express 2.0 has a 5.0 GT/s transfer rate

#### PCI Express 3.1 x2

[SYBA 5 port Non-RAID SATA III 6Gbp/s PCI-e x4 Controller Card](https://www.sybausa.com/index.php?route=product/product&path=64_181_85&product_id=1027&filter=38,19&limit=32) (340 MB/s/port) **(WARNING: this card provides x2 lane width but requires an x4 slot. Use it only if you lack the slot width for the 2 preceding picks and/or need more than 4 ports)**

## SSDs

### SATA

Unless you're using the SSD in an extremely write-heavy application (e.g. as an array cache drive) or need > 2 TB of capacity, get the Crucial MX500.

#### Performance & endurance
